          <p class="p-title">No-Pressure enviroment</p>
          <p>Following the philosophy of Bob Ross, Artsy at Heart creates a no-pressure enviroment where mistakes are just happy little accidents! Nothing can't be fixed, and everything is apart of your own style. Everything you paint in the class is yours, so it can be shared, or it can be kept secret, but we encourage you every step of the way, including if you want to show it off to your friends! We publish our students paintings on our facebook page every week, however, you can easily opt out if you'd rather keep your creation to yourself. Every week, you'll be encouraged by your peers and Mary herself, and with time, you'll be an artist yourself!</p>

          <p class="p-title">Supplies are taken care of!</p>
          <p>No idea anything about painting supplies? That's okay! We take care of all needed supplies. Canvases, paints, brushes. If you can use it to create art, we have it! Providing the supplies for each student means that no one is left out, and everyone is using the same quality brushes, paints, and canvases, so no one has an advantage on another. Everyone can create their own magnificient works of art! Please note that this means limited seating per class. However, if you call or contact Mary prior to a class, she will do her best to make sure that more supplies are brought for everyone who wants to attend!</p>

          <p>We can teach anyone to paint, and due to this our classes tend to be diverse, with people from all over the area. Plenty of friends can be made while painting in our classes! Whether you've been a regular in an area for twenty years, or if you're just moving in, you can join in on a class and meet someone new, which could turn into a full blown friendship! Our classes are full of the friendliest people in the area, and no matter who comes to a class, they'll be treated like they've been apart of the group for years!</p>

          <p>Diverse subjects allows each person to grow and develop into a well-rounded painter. Each painting comes with its own challenges! By also allowing painters to create different artworks, boredom and repition should not be an issue, and every class should be exciting and different from the last!</p>
