           <p class="p-title">Colorful Cow</p>
           <p>This Pop culture piece was a new avenue for Mary, exploring her love for nature and its animals with a very modern and abstract style. Combining these two dinstinct styles, she produced one of her first pieces of this type, simply called "Colorful Cow". This colorful cow has led her to do more works of this style, and remains to an example of the unique styles she can combine in order to make works of art.</p>

            <p class="p-title">Rabbits</p>
            <p>Simply labeled "Rabbits", this is a great representation of the ability of Mary Sue. She takes her love for nature and puts it into a piece of art on a canvas. She incorporated realism styles whiel also keeping her own artsy style, giving it a very unique tone.</p>

            <p>This flower is yet another example of how Mary adores nature, and tries to incorporate her love for nature in her works. Using such a simple subject, one may wonder how to create art from it, yet Mary can achieves this elegantly in this work.</p> <br><br><br><br>

            <p class="p-title">Intarsia<p>
            <p>Intarsia is a very complex woodworking art that can produce amazing results. Mary has recently picked up this artform, and is able to take requests if you want a piece done in this style. Intarsia is very complex, so naturally, it takes a long time for a piece to come together, but the results are stunngin and well worth the wait. In the piece pictured, "Indian Scouts" is one of the very first pieces she made, and remains and one of the hallmark examples of what can be accomplished with this artform.</p>

            <p>Aside from woodworkings, Mary started out, and still does, murals. If you need a small office decorated with a painting, or if your workshop needs a grand mural to display your wealth, Mary can do it. Mary has many murals around her local area accreditted to her name, and each one speaks volumes about the ability that Mary has with a paintbrush.</p>
