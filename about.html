          <h2>Life Story of a Small Town Artist</h2>
          <p><strong>Mary Frazier</strong> has been painting for much of her adult life, with much experience in many forms of art. She was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and currently resides in Grenada, Mississippi, a small town about an hour away from Mississippi's capitol. She loves nature, and that is the main subject in many of her paintings, specifically animals.</p>
          <p>Much of her career she painted for other people. Whether they needed a solid coat on the inside of their kitchen, or if they needed a grand mural painting in their huge workshop, Mary did it. Even though she has lived in a small town with not too many people, she has still made a name for herself in the local area and enjoys the friends she makes while doing what she does best, painting.</p>

        <p>Recently, Mary had been asked to pick up another form of art for a client, called intarsia. Intarsia is an elaborate form of marquetry using inlays in wood, which can become very complex and very hard for people to do. however, Mary crafted beutiful crafts for her client based on his descriptions, and all the while learned a new skill in which she does for everyone now. This incredibly difficult craft is her most recent learning, and she has taken to doing it and combining it with her painting skills to creat elaborate works.</p>
        <p>Today, Mary lives  a quiet life where she just enjoys her paintings. Among other things, Mary maintains a normal lifestyle, with wonderful, wonderful grandkids, and uses her artistry skills to decorate her own home. She stays busy with jobs from friends and family, making signs or making furniture look new. She goes to church, and will occasionally watch her grandkids. She hopes to pass down her painting skills to her family and friends, and wishes that everyone could enjoy her craft as much as she does.</p>
