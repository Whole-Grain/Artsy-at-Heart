# Artsy-at-Heart
A website made for an artist in a small town looking to grow her business.

Hello, this project was made by Gage Schaffer and Sophia Baker. This website started out as an attempt to bring the work of an artist to the internet, and what was once a simple website that just got the job done, turned into a website that we can be proud of. We worked very hard on this and overhauled many things, all in an effort to make a website that the artist would love, and that people viewing it could navigate with ease and efficiency.


Whole Website:

-The name "Artsy at Heart" was actually coined for the purpose of this website. Beforehand, the artist simply had her art and her classes with no name. She made the name because she wanted to show her absolute love for her artwork.

-The layout was inspired by a collection of popular artists' websites. Most of them looked very nice and professional. Each followed what seemed to be a pattern: centered header and navigation, seperate sections of content, and different pages for different styles of their artwork.

-The color scheme was selected by the artist, but we made subtle changes to make sure the colors weren't so harsh on the user, all the while keeping the artist's wants in mind. She had originally wanted a slightly brighter version of our final pallette with more colors, but she agreed that the darker colors with less variety helped visibility.

-We checked the responsiveness of the website using the developer tools in Google Chrome by viewing the pages with the preset sizes of devices in order to make sure that the website looked good at any screen size.

-The favicon is a simple logo that the artist agreed on. While it is not present on the website, due to her not wanting a logo to be identified with her artwork, we still had permission to use it as the favicon to make the website more professional and complete.


Home Page:

-The seperated sections of content all provide a snippet of material that are present on other pages. We made sure to make it look appealing, simple to read, and easy to navigate. We also made sure to feature the artist's prominent works on the front, as per her request.

-The first section is dedicated solely to her artwork, and her more popular pieces are featured. The works are on the left with a brief description of each picture beside them. There is a link, at the bottom of the first section, to the gallety page of our website. The second section is dedicated to the classes that artist offers the public. The picture on the right is a shot from a recent class, while the description on the left was approved by the client; a link is present below this section as well linking to the classes page of our website. The third section is about the custom artwork, and is set up the same as the first section with a link connected to the custom page.


Classes Page:

-This page is dedicated to, the painting classes offered by the artist, as well as the enviroment of the classes. We chose a similar layout to the first and third section of the homepage, with pictures on the left, and a brief description on the right complete with a header. The bottom also has an area to show details, and links, on how to sign-up for one of these classes.

-This page contains several pictures that were taken from a few different classes, as well as descriptions of the enviroment. Each picture and description were picked or approved by the artist.


Gallery Page:

-This page was solely dedicated to showing off the works of this artist. We picked a select few paintings and displayed them in a responsive column style, before giving each one a short description.


Custom Page:

-This page is all about the custom artwork that the artist offers. The two biggest sections of content were placed side-by-side at the top of the page. These sections display her main types of art, because she wanted to show that restoring furniture, or anything else listed in the lower section of content, was not her main type of artistry. Below the main two columns are the rest of the types of art or services she offers. They are much smaller, as they are secondary services that the artist is not known for.


About Page:

-The artist did not want a huge section about her life to be put on her website, but she agreed to have  at least a little information to allow user to see who is behind the works of art. We made a modest description with a picture in the top right of the page, accompanied by the text placed around it. 

-The text tells a very condensed biography of the artist's life to keep user interested and let them get to know the artist a little, but the briefness keeps them from getting confused or discouraged by reading it.


Contact Page:

-This page is very simple, with a brief message and then a form. This form has the basic information fields, complete with one for a return email address. A submit button was also placed underneath the information fields.

-The form uses mail_handler.php, which also serves as the landing page.


Mail_handler.php (landing page)

-This doubles as our form and  landing page for user who submit information in the form. It keeps the same header and footer at the other pages, however, the content is simply a bit of text and 4 functional buttons with color swapping effects on hover. Each button leads back to a different page of the website. These buttons allow us to avoid the infamous "CLICK HERE", let the user know that their attempt to contact the artist worked, and give the user some direction after they send the form.
